# PROJECT: musexmlexport
A utility to extract an ECG rhythm strip from a MUSE(R) XML file. It converts MUSE XML files to CSV files, suitable for import into Excel and MATLAB.

This program is is written for use with **Python 3**, since version 0.3.0.

# CONTENTS
A listing of the MUSE XML Export contents is:

 - musexmlex.py : The Python script used to read the MUSE XML files and export a '.csv' file, suitable for import into other programs.
 - README.md : This file
 - LICENSE : A copy of the GNU General Public License. A copy is also included as part of the musexmlex.py script.

# PREPARATION

The 'musexmlex.py' script is a Python script; hence, the Python engine must be
installed before using the script. This script was verified using version 3.7.2.

See www.python.org for information about installing Python on your target 
machine.

After installation, make sure 'python3.exe' is in your system path before 
continuing.

## USE

1. Copy the  Python script to a location easily referened by your command-line 
   window.
2. Run the Python script, at the command-line, to export the ECG rhythm to a
   comma-separated value ('.csv') file. The script writes the output in 
   microvolts.
   
   For example:
   
   python musexmlex.py MUSE_FILE.xml
   
   Exports the ECG rhythm stored in the XML file to a file named 
   'MUSE_FILE.csv', assuming the following:
   
   a. The Python script 'musexmlex.py' is in the current-working directory.

   b. The file 'MUSE_FILE.xml' is in the current-working directory.

   c. Python is installed on the machine, and it is in the system path.
